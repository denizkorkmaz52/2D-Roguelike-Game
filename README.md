2D rogue like dungeon game


Hello this is my 2D rogue like game. In this game there are 6 levels, each level use **procedural generation** technique to be created and have various enemies. Before starting game you can choose one of the 3 characters player can play. Each character have different weapons.

When you enter a room the doors of the room will be closed until you clear the room from enemies. When you clear all the enemies you can continue clearing all the rooms in the dungeon also you can find chests that carry ammunation, new guns and health when you enter a room or clear a room. After clearing all rooms you can face with the boss or bosses and when you defeat them the current level will be completed and you can start the new level.
